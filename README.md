Once again this is just a giant dumpster full of tiny projects and learning materials that I'd thought I'd put on GitHub...for various reasons.

Included is a rating system based on whether or not I'll come back to it.

BLUE = I'll likely come back to this project again soon or reference it in some way.
GREEN = I'll PROBABLY come back, I might not. Depends on how big the project is.
YELLOW = Middle ground.
ORANGE = I won't come back to this project. It's just in here for organization reasons or just so I can access the project anywhere (if I'm currently working on it).
RED = Garbage. In like a week I'll prolly not know why it's there.

Included are branches to different tiers of "whether or not I'll come back to it"
